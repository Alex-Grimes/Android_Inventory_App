# Android_Inventory_App
A inventory application designed for android devices


Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This application was made to explore android studio and mobile applications design principles this paticular application was designed to be an inventory application 
this application has the functionality to track inventory as well as send out sms notifications to users to alert them to low quantitys. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

To be succesful in this application i implemented typical authorization features like login and regestration as well as the screens for inventory managment there are screens that allow you to add remove and edit inventory as well as an sms toggle button i made a conscience effort to follow the IOS and Android design principles i kept all elements clean and clear as well as well labled i kept to a consistent color design and used well known icons. 


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

As for codeing the application i stuck to SOLID design principles and kept the work oraganized useing a white board for visualization of what all needed to be done and what was completed i plan of sticking to this method of development for the forseeable future. 


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested this application by building an APK file first and foremost as this ensured there were no pure bugs in the code after the apk was built and the app was launchable i made sure to login and use all of the applications functionality to confirm that all the features work well and as expected. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I did not have experince with useing android stuio going into this process so that was a learning curve that i needed to overcome however there is alot of documentation on this subject and made the learning process much easier. 


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I feel like the visualization of portion of the data chart was done extreamly well and could be used in theory in future projects.
